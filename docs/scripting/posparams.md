# Handling positional parameters

![](keywords>bash shell scripting arguments positional parameters options)

## Intro

The day will come when you want to give arguments to your scripts. These
arguments are known as **positional parameters**. Some relevant special
parameters are described below:

| Parameter(s)     | Description                                                                                                                     |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `$0`             | the first positional parameter, equivalent to `argv[0]` in C, see [the first argument](../scripting/posparams.md#the_first_argument) |
| `$FUNCNAME`      | the function name (<u>**attention**</u>: inside a function, `$0` is still the `$0` of the shell, **not** the function name)     |
| `$1 ... $9`      | the argument list elements from 1 to 9                                                                                          |
| `${10} ... ${N}` | the argument list elements beyond 9 (note the [parameter expansion](../syntax/pe.md) syntax!)                                        |
| `$*`             | all positional parameters except `$0`, see [mass usage](../scripting/posparams.md#mass_usage)                                        |
| `$@`             | all positional parameters except `$0`, see [mass usage](../scripting/posparams.md#mass_usage)                                        |
| `$#`             | the number of arguments, not counting `$0`                                                                                      |

These positional parameters reflect exactly what was given to the script
when it was called.

Option-switch parsing (e.g. `-h` for displaying help) is not performed
at this point.

See also [the dictionary entry for "parameter"](/dict/terms/parameter).

## The first argument

The very first argument you can access is referenced as `$0`. It is
usually set to the script's name exactly as called, and it's set on
shell initialization:

<u>Testscript</u> - it just echos `$0`:

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "$0"

You see, `$0` is always set to the name the script is called with (`>`
is the prompt...):

    > ./testscript 
    ./testscript

    > /usr/bin/testscript
    /usr/bin/testscript

However, this isn't true for login shells:

    > echo "$0"
    -bash

In other terms, `$0` is not a positional parameter, it's a special
parameter independent from the positional parameter list. It can be set
to anything. In the **ideal** case it's the pathname of the script, but
since this gets set on invocation, the invoking program can easily
influence it (the `login` program does that for login shells, by
prefixing a dash, for example).

Inside a function, `$0` still behaves as described above. To get the
function name, use `$FUNCNAME`.

## Shifting

The builtin command `shift` is used to change the positional parameter
values:

- `$1` will be discarded
- `$2` will become `$1`
- `$3` will become `$2`
- ...
- in general: `$N` will become `$N-1`

The command can take a number as argument: Number of positions to shift.
e.g. `shift 4` shifts `$5` to `$1`.

## Using them

Enough theory, you want to access your script-arguments. Well, here we
go.

### One by one

One way is to access specific parameters:

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Total number of arguments: $#"
    echo "Argument 1: $1"
    echo "Argument 2: $2"
    echo "Argument 3: $3"
    echo "Argument 4: $4"
    echo "Argument 5: $5"

While useful in another situation, this way is lacks flexibility. The
maximum number of arguments is a fixedvalue - which is a bad idea if you
write a script that takes many filenames as arguments.

=\> forget that one

### Loops

There are several ways to loop through the positional parameters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can code a [C-style for-loop](../syntax/ccmd/c_for.md) using `$#` as the
end value. On every iteration, the `shift`-command is used to shift the
argument list:

    numargs=$#
    for ((i=1 ; i <= numargs ; i++))
    do
        echo "$1"
        shift
    done

Not very stylish, but usable. The `numargs` variable is used to store
the initial value of `$#` because the shift command will change it as
the script runs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another way to iterate one argument at a time is the `for` loop without
a given wordlist. The loop uses the positional parameters as a wordlist:

    for arg
    do
        echo "$arg"
    done

<u>Advantage:</u> The positional parameters will be preserved

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next method is similar to the first example (the `for` loop), but it
doesn't test for reaching `$#`. It shifts and checks if `$1` still
expands to something, using the [test command](../commands/classictest.md):

    while [ "$1" ]
    do
        echo "$1"
        shift
    done

Looks nice, but has the disadvantage of stopping when `$1` is empty
(null-string). Let's modify it to run as long as `$1` is defined (but
may be null), using [parameter expansion for an alternate
value](../syntax/pe.md#use_an_alternate_value):

    while [ "${1+defined}" ]; do
      echo "$1"
      shift
    done

### Getopts

There is a [small tutorial dedicated to
`getopts`](../howto/getopts_tutorial.md) (*under construction*).

## Mass usage

### All Positional Parameters

Sometimes it's necessary to just "relay" or "pass" given arguments to
another program. It's very inefficient to do that in one of these loops,
as you will destroy integrity, most likely (spaces!).

The shell developers created `$*` and `$@` for this purpose.

As overview:

| Syntax | Effective result            |
|:-------|:----------------------------|
| `$*`   | `$1 $2 $3 ... ${N}`         |
| `$@`   | `$1 $2 $3 ... ${N}`         |
| `"$*"` | `"$1c$2c$3c...c${N}"`       |
| `"$@"` | `"$1" "$2" "$3" ... "${N}"` |

Without being quoted (double quotes), both have the same effect: All
positional parameters from `$1` to the last one used are expanded
without any special handling.

When the `$*` special parameter is double quoted, it expands to the
equivalent of: `"$1c$2c$3c$4c........$N"`, where 'c' is the first
character of `IFS`.

But when the `$@` special parameter is used inside double quotes, it
expands to the equivanent of...

`"$1" "$2" "$3" "$4" ..... "$N"`

...which **reflects all positional parameters as they were set
initially** and passed to the script or function. If you want to re-use
your positional parameters to **call another program** (for example in a
wrapper-script), then this is the choice for you, use double quoted
`"$@"`.

Well, let's just say: **You almost always want a quoted `"$@"`!**

### Range Of Positional Parameters

Another way to mass expand the positional parameters is similar to what
is possible for a range of characters using [substring
expansion](../syntax/pe.md#substring_expansion) on normal parameters and the
mass expansion range of [arrays](../syntax/arrays.md).

`${@:START:COUNT}`

`${*:START:COUNT}`

`"${@:START:COUNT}"`

`"${*:START:COUNT}"`

The rules for using `@` or `*` and quoting are the same as above. This
will expand `COUNT` number of positional parameters beginning at
`START`. `COUNT` can be omitted (`${@:START}`), in which case, all
positional parameters beginning at `START` are expanded.

If `START` is negative, the positional parameters are numbered in
reverse starting with the last one.

`COUNT` may not be negative, i.e. the element count may not be
decremented.

<u>**Example:**</u> START at the last positional parameter:

    echo "${@: -1}"

<u>**Attention**</u>: As of Bash 4, a `START` of `0` includes the
special parameter `$0`, i.e. the shell name or whatever \$0 is set to,
when the positional parameters are in use. A `START` of `1` begins at
`$1`. In Bash 3 and older, both `0` and `1` began at `$1`.

## Setting Positional Parameters

Setting positional parameters with command line arguments, is not the
only way to set them. The [builtin command, set](../commands/builtin/set.md)
may be used to "artificially" change the positional parameters from
inside the script or function:

    set "This is" my new "set of" positional parameters

    # RESULTS IN
    # $1: This is
    # $2: my
    # $3: new
    # $4: set of
    # $5: positional
    # $6: parameters

It's wise to signal "end of options" when setting positional parameters
this way. If not, the dashes might be interpreted as an option switch by
`set` itself:

    # both ways work, but behave differently. See the article about the set command!
    set -- ...
    set - ...

Alternately this will also preserve any verbose (-v) or tracing (-x)
flags, which may otherwise be reset by `set`

    set -$- ...

## Production examples

### Using a while loop

To make your program accept options as standard command syntax:

`COMMAND [options] <params>` \# Like 'cat -A file.txt'

See simple option parsing code below. It's not that flexible. It doesn't
auto-interpret combined options (-fu USER) but it works and is a good
rudimentary way to parse your arguments.

    #!/bin/sh
    # Keeping options in alphabetical order makes it easy to add more.

    while :
    do
        case "$1" in
          -f | --file)
          file="$2"   # You may want to check validity of $2
          shift 2
          ;;
          -h | --help)
          display_help  # Call your function
          # no shifting needed here, we're done.
          exit 0
          ;;
          -u | --user)
          username="$2" # You may want to check validity of $2
          shift 2
          ;;
          -v | --verbose)
              #  It's better to assign a string, than a number like "verbose=1"
          #  because if you're debugging the script with "bash -x" code like this:
          #
          #    if [ "$verbose" ] ...
          #
          #  You will see:
          #
          #    if [ "verbose" ] ...
          #
              #  Instead of cryptic
          #
          #    if [ "1" ] ...
          #
          verbose="verbose"
          shift
          ;;
          --) # End of all options
          shift
          break;
          -*)
          echo "Error: Unknown option: $1" >&2
          exit 1
          ;;
          *)  # No more options
          break
          ;;
        esac
    done

    # End of file

### Filter unwanted options with a wrapper script

This simple wrapper enables filtering unwanted options (here: `-a` and
`--all` for `ls`) out of the command line. It reads the positional
parameters and builds a filtered array consisting of them, then calls
`ls` with the new option set. It also respects the `--` as "end of
options" for `ls` and doesn't change anything after it:

    #!/bin/bash

    # simple ls(1) wrapper that doesn't allow the -a option

    options=()  # the buffer array for the parameters
    eoo=0       # end of options reached

    while [[ $1 ]]
    do
        if ! ((eoo)); then
        case "$1" in
          -a)
              shift
              ;;
          --all)
              shift
              ;;
          -[^-]*a*|-a?*)
              options+=("${1//a}")
              shift
              ;;
          --)
              eoo=1
              options+=("$1")
              shift
              ;;
          *)
              options+=("$1")
              shift
              ;;
        esac
        else
        options+=("$1")

        # Another (worse) way of doing the same thing:
        # options=("${options[@]}" "$1")
        shift
        fi
    done

    /bin/ls "${options[@]}"
