# The set builtin command

FIXME incomplete - text, examples, maybe extended description

## Synopsis

    set [--abefhkmnptuvxBCHP] <-o OPTIONNAME> [-][--] <POSPARAMS>

## Description

`set` is primarily made to

- set the positional parameters (see [handling positional
  parameters](scripting/posparams.md)) to `<POSPARAMS>`
- set shell attributes with short options (see below)
- set shell attributes with long option names (see below)

Without any options, `set` displays all shell- and environment-variables
(only is POSIX-mode) in a re-usable format `NAME=VALUE`.

### Attributes

All attributes below can be switched on using `-X` and switched off
using `+X`. This is done because of the historical meaning of the `-` to
set flags (true for most commands on UNIX(r)).

| Flag | Optionname                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `-e` | `errexit`                                                | When set, the shell exits when a simple command in a command list exits non-zero (`FALSE`). This is not done in situations, where the exit code is already checked (`if`, `while`, `until`, `||`, `&&`)                                                     |

| `-h` | `hashall`                                                | Remembers the location of commands when they're called (hashing). Enabled by default.                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `-m` | `monitor`                                                | **Monitor mode**. With job control, a short descriptive line is printed when a backgroud job ends. Default is "on" for interactive shells (with job control).                                                                                               |
| `-n` | `noexec`                                                 | Read and parse but **do not execute commands** - useful for checking scripts for syntax errors. Ignored by interactive shells.                                                                                                                              |

If no option name is given, all options are printed with their current status.                                             |
| `-p` | `privileged`                                             | Turn on privileged mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `-u` | `nounset`                                                | Treat unset variables as an error when performing parameter expansion. Non-interactive shells exit on this error.                                                                                                                                           |

| `-B` | `braceexpand`                                            | The shell performs [brace expansion](syntax/expansion/brace.md) This is on by default.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `-C` | \<BOOKMARK:tag_noclobber\>`noclobber`                    | Don't overwrite files on redirection operations. You can override that by specifying the `>|` redirection operator when needed. See [redirection](syntax/redirection.md)                                                                                      |

Defaults to `on` for interactive shells.                                                                                                                                                                                |

Positional parameters are unchanged (unlike using `--`!) when no further arguments are given. |
| `--` |                                                          | If no arguments follow, the positional parameters are unset. With arguments, the positional parameters are set, even if the strings begin with a `-` (dash) like an option.                                                                                 |

This is enabled by default when the shell is interactive, unless the shell is started with `--noediting` option.                                                                                         |

|      | `ignoreeof`                                              | The effect is as if the shell command `IGNOREEOF=10` had been executed.

## Examples

Tag a part of a shell script to output debugging information (`-x`):

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
...
set -x # on
...
set +x # off
...
```

## Portability considerations

`set` and its basic behaviour and options are specified by POSIX(r).
However, options that influence Bash-specific things are not portable,
naturally.
