===== Token Recognition and Shell Grammar =====

a more human-readable version of the following topics:

  * [[http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_03]]
  * [[http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_10]]

===== General =====
A simplified version of `man bash' and interesting bash tricks.:-)
&gt; The whole site is meant to be like that: a simplified or better human-readable collection of manpage snipplets. Maybe a page with the main topics of bash manpage that link to the proper articles would be good (I just don't have enough articles heh) - a kind of summary page --- Jan


===== Some ideas =====

**hmm maybe some of this stuff could make it somewhere to the wiki...:)** 

  *  an article about how to do ksh coprocess in bash (:V4: may be obsolete regarding [[bash4 | Bash 4 features]])
    - single way -&gt; process substitution 
    - 2 way name pipes
  * let's write a interactive tutorial script that teaches readline/bash (like C-h t in emacs, or vimtutor or vilearn)
  * programmable history: http://pastebin.bash-hackers.org/index.php?show=22

===== Implemented =====

==== Bash For Loop Multi-word lines ====

From this solution on modifying the internal Field Separator (IFS) in bash I found here:
  * http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Debian/2006-08/msg00462.html

&gt; added to [[syntax:ccmd:classic_for|the for-loop-article]] as example, but also made some critical comments; thanks --- Jan

==== Getopts tutorial ====
  * My school offers a UNIX programming course (C, shell, etc.). I use this site extensively to help my friends taking this course learn concepts such as I/O redirection etc. As it gets more advanced they need to do option parsing. Therefore I would like to see a &quot;getopts illustrated&quot; article or some such, showing the breakdown of how it parses parameters.
