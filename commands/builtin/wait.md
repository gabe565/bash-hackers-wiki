====== The wait builtin command ======

===== Synopsis =====
&lt;code&gt;wait [-f] [-n] [-p VARNAME] [ID...]&lt;/code&gt;

===== Description =====
The ''wait'' builtin command is used to wait for job completion and return exit status.

  * if ''ID'' is a job specification, it waits for all processes in the pipeline of this job
  * waits for a specific job (asynchronous command) and report its exit status if one or more ''ID'' is given
  * waits for all running jobs (asynchronous commands)
  * waits for &quot;the next&quot; job (''-n'' option)
  * waits for termination instead of status change (''-f'' option)

''ID'' may be an operating system process identifier or a shell job specification.
