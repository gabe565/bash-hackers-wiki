# Shell Humor

Nothing special, just my private collection of some more or less funny
shell stuff I saw during the years.

Usually Bash and/or Linux (GNU Toolset) specific.

    $ %blow
    -bash: fg: %blow: no such job

    $ ar m god
    ar: creating god

    $ touch /pussy
    touch: cannot touch `/pussy': Permission denied

    $ mount; fsck; fsck; fsck; umount; sleep

    # the lover variant
    $ unzip; strip; touch; finger; grep; mount; fsck; more; yes; fsck; fsck; umount; sleep

    # it's not directly funny, only because it's not obvious that this is an sed command
    # for the <<<, it works only in Bash
    $ sed streetlight <<< reeter
    lighter

    # see above for comments
    $ sed statement <<< cat
    cement

    $ \(-
    bash: (-: command not found

    $ echo '[q]sa[ln0=aln256%Pln256/snlbx]sb3135071790101768542287578439snlbxq'|dc
    GET A LIFE!
