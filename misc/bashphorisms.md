# The Bashphorisms

Bashphorisms are aphorisms for the IRC channel `#bash` on Freenode. Keep
in mind that this version is a snapshot, the bashphorisms are changed
here and there. Also, [another
snapshot](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/064).

I think `greycat` was the first one who had the idea, but I'm not sure.

Our bashphorisms can be queried from `greybot` using `!bN`, where `N` is
the bashphorism number.

And yes, these bashphorisms reflect the daily reality in `#bash`.

| Number | Bashphorism                                                                                                                                                   |
|:-------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0      | The questioner will never tell you what they are really doing the first time they ask.                                                                        |
| 1      | The questioner's first description of the problem/question will be misleading.                                                                                |
| 2      | The questioner will keep changing the question until it drives the helpers in the channel insane.                                                             |
| 3      | Offtopicness will continue until someone asks a bash question that falls under bashphorisms 1 and/or 2, and `greycat` gets pissed off.                        |
| 4      | The questioner will not read and apply the answers he is given but will instead continue to practice bashphorism \#1 and bashphorism \#2.                     |
| 5      | The ignorant will continually mis-educate the other noobies.                                                                                                  |
| 6      | When given a choice of solutions, the newbie will always choose the wrong one.                                                                                |
| 7      | The newbie will always find a reason to say, "It doesn't work."                                                                                               |
| 8      | If you don't know to whom the bashphorism's referring, it's you.                                                                                              |
| 9      | All examples given by the questioner will be broken, misleading, wrong, and not representative of the actual question.                                        |
| 10     | See B1                                                                                                                                                        |
| 11     | Please apply `(( % 10 ))` to the bashphorism value.                                                                                                           |
| 12     | All logic is deniable; however, some logic will \*plonk\* you if you deny it.                                                                                 |
| 13     | Everyone ignores greycat when he is right. When he is wrong, it is !b1                                                                                        |
| 14     | The newbie doesn't actually know what he's asking. If he did, he wouldn't need to ask.                                                                        |
| 15     | The more advanced you are, the more likely you are to be overcomplicating it.                                                                                 |
| 16     | The more beginner you are, the more likely you are to be overcomplicating it.                                                                                 |
| 17     | A newbie comes to \#bash to get his script confirmed. He leaves disappointed.                                                                                 |
| 18     | The newbie will not accept the answer you give, no matter how right it is.                                                                                    |
| 19     | The newbie is a bloody loon.                                                                                                                                  |
| 20     | The newbie will always have some excuse for doing it wrong.                                                                                                   |
| 21     | When the newbie's question is ambiguous, the proper interpretation will be whichever one makes the problem the hardest to solve.                              |
| 22     | The newcomer will abuse the bot's factoid triggers for their own entertainment until someone gets annoyed enough to ask them to message it privately instead. |
| 23     | Everyone is a newcomer.                                                                                                                                       |
| 24     | The newcomer will address greybot as if it were human.                                                                                                        |
| 25     | The newbie won't accept any answer that uses practical or standard tools.                                                                                     |
| 26     | The newbie will not TELL you about this restriction until you have wasted half an hour.                                                                       |
| 27     | The newbie will lie.                                                                                                                                          |
| 28     | When the full horror of the newbie's true goal is revealed, the newbie will try to restate the goal to trick you into answering. Newbies are stupid.          |
| 29     | It's always git. Or python virtualenv. Or docker. One of those pieces of shit. ALWAYS.                                                                        |
| 30     | They won't show you the homework assignment. That would make it too easy.                                                                                     |
| 31     | Your teacher is a f\*\*king idiot.                                                                                                                            |
| 32     | The more horrifyingly wrong a proposed solution is, the more likely it will be used.                                                                          |
| 33     | The newbie cannot explain what he is doing, or why. He will show you incomprehensible, nonworking code instead. What? You can't read his mind?!               |
