# Bash compound commands

The main part of Bash's syntax are the so-called **compound commands**.
They're called like that because they use "real" commands ([simple
commands](/syntax/basicgrammar#simple_commands) or
[lists](/syntax/basicgrammar#lists)) and knit some intelligence around
them. That is what the essential "Bash language" is made of.

## Command grouping

- grouping: [command grouping](grouping_plain)
- grouping again: [command grouping in a subshell](grouping_subshell)

## Conditional reactions

Note that conditionals can also be scripted using
[list](/syntax/basicgrammar#lists), which are syntax elements, not
commands.

- the "new" test command: [conditional
  expression](conditional_expression)
- if-clause: [conditional branching](if_clause)
- case statement: [pattern-based branching](case)

## Loops

- [classic for-loop](classic_for)
- [C-style for-loop](c_for)
- [while loop](while_loop)
- [until loop](until_loop)

## Misc

- math: [arithmetic evaluation](arithmetic_eval)
